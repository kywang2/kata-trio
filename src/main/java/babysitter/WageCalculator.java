//Variations:
//Create a minimum wage rule and ensure that the babysitter does not receive pay that
// falls below the minimum wage for the entire shift. For example a minimum wage of $9:
//With one hour pre-bedtime and four hours pre midnight/post bedtime hours would pay $45.
//With one hour pre-bedtime and one hour pre midnight/post bedtime hours would remain $20.
//Allow partial hour pay and take start/end times as String arguments.
//In real life just pay the sitter a flat rate. They're taking care of your kids, they deserve it.
